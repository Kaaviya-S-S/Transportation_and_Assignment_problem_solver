**Optimization Techniques - Assignment and Transportation Problems**

This project implements solutions to two classic optimization problems: Transportation and Assignment Problems. It focuses on efficient resource allocation and cost minimization. The solution leverages well-known algorithms and methods for solving these problems.

The project includes two primary classes:  
Hungarian Class: Solves the Assignment Problem using the Hungarian Algorithm.  
TransportationProblem Class: 1. Solves the Transportation Problem using:  
                                * North-West Corner Method  
                                * Least Cost Method  
                                * Vogelâ€™s Approximation Method  
                             2. Optimizes the solution using the Modified Distribution Method (MODI).
