**Optimization Techniques - Assignment and Transportation Problems**

This project implements solutions to two classic optimization problems: Transportation and Assignment Problems. It focuses on efficient resource allocation and cost minimization. The solution leverages well-known algorithms and methods for solving these problems.

The project includes two primary classes:  
* Hungarian Class: Solves the Assignment Problem using the **Hungarian Algorithm**.
* TransportationProblem Class: Solves the Transportation Problem using **North-West Corner Method**, **Least Cost Method**, **Vogelâ€™s Approximation Method** and Optimizes the solution using the **Modified Distribution Method (MODI).**

The implementation integrates with Gradio, providing a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction and visualization of results.
